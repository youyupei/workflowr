## Introduction

**Log-sum-exp trick** is important in machine learning awaring of **underflow problem**. Underflow is that some programming languages/software fail to represent extremely small value and set to 0. It could end up with incorrect results. 

## Problems
In [our probabilistic model](https://youyupei.github.io/workflowr/docs/probabilistic_model.html) we have to compute $\sum_{m = 1}^{M}P(\boldsymbol x_i|z_i =m, H_i =1)$, in which the $P(\boldsymbol x_i|z_i =m, H_i =1)$ is going to be subject to the underflow problem[^1]. What we have from the DTW is $log\ P(\boldsymbol x_i|z_i =m, H_i =1)$, a.k.a the log-likelihood. 

##The idea of log-sum-exp trick:

$$
\begin{align}
& \ \ \ \ \ \ log\ \sum_i e^{a_i} \\

& = log (e^b\sum_i e^{a_i - b}) \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{,where } b = {Max}(a_i)\\

&= b + log (\sum_i e^{a_i - b})

\end{align}
$$

[^1]: Acctually not. The range of the  $log\ P(\boldsymbol x_i|z_i =m, H_i =1)$ is roughly (-10,-2), which could be represented in R. The log-likelihood is not that small because we are actually taking te geometric mean, i.e. we use $[P(\boldsymbol x_i|z_i =m, H_i =1)]^{-N_{m,i}}$ instead of $P(\boldsymbol x_i|z_i =m, H_i =1)$, where $N_{m,i}$ is the length of dtw path.
