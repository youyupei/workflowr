## Done

cDNA data analysis:

  * Select Spike-in reads from cDNA dataset
  * Pair each fastq read with its raw signal.
  * Successfully run tombo resquiggle


## To Do (ordered by the priority)

* Generate random motif in different lengths and check their occurrances within spike-in sequence.

* Run Tombo resquiggle on spike-in reads the check the distribution of the squiggle assigned to each base.

* Statistics of current level to check whether or not the average level will vary in differet channel or different time in a same channel

* Play with the spike-in reads: 

	1. Separate spike-in reads into training set and validation set (validation set comes from the different isoform with the training set).
	2. For validation set, randomly pick some exon boundary and infer the potential motifs from mapped spike-in reads.
	3. Check the number of occurrences of the motifs in the training set, tune the length of motifs to guarantee enough number of occurrences. 
	4. Clip out squiggles from motifs as well as the squiggles from corresponding exon boundary in validation set by using Tombo.
	6. Try to use DTW to match the squiggles

* Figure out best setting in minimap2

* Check the accuracy of squiggle assignment given by Tombo (Maybe by squencing the regions near splicing sites)

# Questions

* Is there currently any method can be use for splicing site identification?
* Is there any recommondation of setting when using minimap2?
