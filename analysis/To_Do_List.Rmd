## Problems and possible solutions

### Tombo resquiggle problem (talked with HJ and MK, 13/5/2019)
 In Tombo resquiggle, the accuracy of the squiggle to sequence alignment largely depends on the correctness of the provided reference sequence. However, for the queried reads, we do not know what is the proper input sequence to extract the signal that is from the exon junction.

**possible solutions**:

It is okay if we can not get an accuracy base-to-base assingment near the exon boundary. We can input base-called seq or annotated reference and extract signal from a wider window as long as we are sure the exon boundary is inside the window. Then we can search the best match inside.

**Note**: 

Mike has mentioned that in many cases the exons could be similar in a gene (because of duplication).

## Done

cDNA data analysis:

  * Select Spike-in reads from cDNA dataset
  * Pair each fastq read with its raw signal.
  * Successfully run tombo resquiggle
  * (11/4/2019)Generate random motif in different lengths and check their occurrances within spike-in sequence.
  * (23/4/2019)Prepare a slides for Terry's group meeting 
  * Figure out setting in minimap2
  * able to extract signal from .fast5 file
  * able to extract squiggle from Tombo resquiggle output
  * Learn about the scappie squiggle (10/5/2019)


## To Do (ordered by the priority)

* Play with the spike-in reads: 

	1. Separate spike-in reads into training set and validation set (validation set comes from the different isoform with the training set).
	2. For validation set, randomly pick some exon boundary and infer the potential motifs from mapped spike-in reads.
	3. Check the number of occurrences of the motifs in the training set, tune the length of motifs to guarantee enough number of occurrences. 
	4. Clip out squiggles from motifs as well as the squiggles from corresponding exon boundary in validation set by using Tombo.
	5. Try to use DTW to match the squiggles (Doing now)

* Figure out how does FLAIR work.

* Statistics of current level to check whether or not the average level will vary in differet channel or different time in a same channel

* Check the accuracy of squiggle assignment given by Tombo (Maybe by squencing the regions near splicing sites)



# Questions

* Is there currently any method can be use for splicing site identification?
  
  FLAIR uses short reads and annotation for splice junction correction.
  
* Is there any recommondation of setting when using minimap2?
  minimap2 support long-read mapping (-x map-ont/map-ont) for transcripts, -x splice is a good option for long-read spliced alignment. There are different options for mapping at the exon junctions:
  1. force the reads map to GT-AG
  2. don't match GT-AG (default)
