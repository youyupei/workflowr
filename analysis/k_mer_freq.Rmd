## Introduction
There we are comparing the 5-mer frequency among Squins DNA, Squins Transcript, and Squins exon junction ($\pm10$ around the splicing site.)


# load data
```{r}
Squins_path = "~/data/Sequin_resources"
Squins_DNA_kmer_count = read.csv("~/data/Sequin_resources/dna_ref_kmer_count.csv",header = F, row.names = 1)
Squins_transcript_kmer_count = read.csv("~/data/Sequin_resources/transcript_ref_kmer_count.csv",header = F, row.names = 1)

Squins_junction_kmer_count = read.csv("~/data/Sequin_resources/junction_kmer_count.csv",header = F, row.names = 1)
```
